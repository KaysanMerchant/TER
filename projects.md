<summary>Anscombe's Quartet Analysis (Click to Expand)</summary>

### Overview
In this analysis, we explore the Anscombe's Quartet dataset, visualize distributions with boxplots, and compute statistical measures like mean, variance, and coefficient of determination.

### Purpose
We created multiple different graphs to show the data in different ways. This is due to the data showing similar values mathematical but looking drastically different on graphs.
